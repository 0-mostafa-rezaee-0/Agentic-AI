Unlike traditional software programs that follow predetermined paths, agents must dynamically adapt their behavior based on changing conditions and new information.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Goal-Oriented Thinking**: Unlike general-purpose LLMs that respond to prompts, agent reasoning engines maintain awareness of specific objectives and work systematically toward achieving them. They can break down complex goals into manageable sub-tasks and prioritize actions accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategic Planning**: The engine doesn't just react to immediate situations but can think several steps ahead, considering the consequences of different actions and selecting strategies that optimize for long-term success."

        "**Short-term Memory (Working Memory)**: This component maintains immediate context during active tasks. It includes the current conversation history, recent observations, and temporary variables needed for ongoing operations. Short-term memory typically has limited capacity but provides fast access to immediately relevant information.\n",

It includes learned facts, successful strategies, user preferences, and historical interaction patterns. Long-term memory allows agents to build upon past experiences and provide personalized responses.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Context Extraction**: Beyond simply receiving data, the perception module actively extracts relevant context, identifies patterns, and filters noise. It determines what information is important for the current task and what can be safely ignored.\n",

The execution system manages these integrations, handling authentication, error recovery, and result processing. Tools might include web search, calculators, databases, or custom business applications.\n",

        "**Structured Messaging**: Agent communications often follow specific formats that include metadata about intent, context, and expected response types. This structure helps maintain clarity and enables more sophisticated interaction patterns.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Context Window Limitations**: Most current LLMs have fixed context windows (ranging from 4K to 1M+ tokens), which constrains how much information an agent can actively consider. Effective agents implement strategies to work within these limitations while maximizing the utility of available context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dynamic Context Management**: Advanced agents employ techniques like context compression, selective attention, and hierarchical summarization to make the most efficient use of their context windows. They prioritize the most relevant information while maintaining awareness of broader context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Token Optimization**: Agents must balance comprehensive context with computational efficiency, making strategic decisions about what information to include in each interaction with the underlying LLM.\n",

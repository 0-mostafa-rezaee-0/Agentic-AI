        "\n",
        "**AI Agents**: Engage in **goal-oriented interactions**. They can initiate conversations, pursue objectives across multiple interactions, and maintain context over extended periods. Agents can work autonomously without constant human guidance.\n",

        "**AI Agents**: Maintain **persistent memory** and state across interactions. They can remember previous conversations, learn from past experiences, and build upon accumulated knowledge over time.\n",

        "**AI Agents**: Employ **multi-step reasoning** and iterative problem-solving. They can decompose complex problems, execute partial solutions, evaluate results, and adjust their approach based on feedback.\n",
